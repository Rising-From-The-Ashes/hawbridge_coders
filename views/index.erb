      <h1>About GMOs</h1>
      <p>According to the magazine Live Science, GMOs are defined as an organism that has had its DNA altered or modified in some way through genetic engineering./p>
      <p>In most cases, a gene is taken from an organism and spliced into the DNA of another, altering the characteristics of the recieving organism in some way.</p>
      <p>The strength of GMOs are their versatility. High-grade industrial silk, for example, can be made from the milk of GMO goats, while GMO rice can produce Vitamin A in starving communities.</p>
      <p>However, GMOs have applications far beyond farming or resource harvesting. Scientists working with organisations like the NIH have been working on "gene therapy" for combating disease.</p>
      <p>Gene therapy involves either changing a mutated gene to treat a hereditary condition or "injecting" the body with cells, such as Killer T-cells, that are genetically programmed to recognize certain pathogens.</p>
      <p>Therapy involves modifying a virus, usually and adenovirus or retrovirus, to carry the information for a healthy gene while removing the DNA that makes the virus damaging.</p>
      <p>The virus enters the target cell as it normally would, then splices the new, helpful gene into the cell through protien cutting. The cell then begins to function normally or to exhibit the trait being modified for.</p>

      <h1>GMO Safety</h1>
      <p>GMOs are often reported as unsafe by many of the most vocal activist groups and media, however, the science seems to point the other way. According to the AAAS in 2012, several notable institutions, such as the American Medical Association, US National Academy for the Sciences, and the British Royal Society, have advocated the safety of GMOs.</p>
      <h2>British Royal Society</h2>
      <p>A report done by the British Royal Society in 1998 stated that, "There is no reason to doubt the safety of foods made from GM ingredients that are currently available, nor to believe that genetic modification makes foods inherently less safe than their conventional counterparts."</p>
      <p>The report also stated, " There is at present no evidence that GM foods cause allergic reactions. The allergenic risks posed by GM plants are in principle no greater than those posed by conventionally derived crops or by plants introduced from other areas of the world," and, "Having reviewed the scientific evidence, the Royal Society concluded that the use of specific viral DNA sequences in GM plants poses a negligible risk to human health."</p>
      <p>Proffessor Jim Smith FRS, the Chairman of the Working Committee that developed that report, is quoted as saying, "We have looked at all of the available research, and found nothing to suggest that the process of genetic modification makes potential foodstuffs inherently unsafe...It is obvious that consumers want their food to be safeguarded by rules that are rigorous enough to prevent any loopholes. But the legislation must not be so restrictive that it removes any incentive for introducing new food products that are potentially beneficial to society."</p>
      <p>The report acknowledges that " It is possible that GM technology could lead to unpredicted harmful changes in the nutritional status of foods (MRC, 2000)," however, it also states that, "Such alterations might also occur in the course of conventional breeding."
      
      <h2>US National Academy for the Sciences</h2>
      <p> Another report, done by the US National Academy for the Sciences in May of 2016, claims that, "Overall, the committee found no conclusive evidence of cause-and-effect relationships between GE crops and environmental problems." The report went on to say, regarding human health, "Although the design and analysis of many animal-feeding studies were not optimal, the many available animal experimental studies taken together provided reasonable evidence that animals were not harmed by eating foods derived from GE crops."
      <p> In addition, the report stated that "No pattern of differences was found among countries in speciÔ¨Åc health problems after the introduction of GE foods in the 1990s." The report studied areas where GMOs were in moderate-to-high use, such as the US and Canada, and compared them to areas where GMOs were not frequently used, such as Western Europe.</p>
